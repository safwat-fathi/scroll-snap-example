## Issues:

- create indicators dynamically.
- on scroll without moving the pointer the section don't get its full height.
- pageup & pagedown keys not working.
- implement scroll event throttling to prevent jumping to next/prev section without scrolling to element full height (if section is higher than the viewport).
